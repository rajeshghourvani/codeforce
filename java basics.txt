classes and objects


classes:collection of objects(which doesnt exist in real world)
object:which exist in real world(it has state and behaviour)


oops:

1)inheritance-Accessing properties from one class to another class(parent->child releation ship)

2)polymorphism(poly+morphism=many forms)-one entity shows multiple behaviours
3)encapsuation-wrapping of data in a form of a single unit
4)abstraction-showing the required content and hiding all other implementations is called abstraction
